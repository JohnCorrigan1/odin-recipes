    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground veal</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsely, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)</li>
    </ol>
